# Feedback

We offer regular **feedback sessions** (every one to two weeks) to discuss open questions and the next steps:

- Feedback sessions can be in person or online
- They can be scheduled via Calendly:

{: .text-center}
[Schedule feedback session](https://calendly.com/gerit-wagner/30min){: .btn .btn-green target="_blank"}
{: .text-center}

To receive feedback on the written document, please

- Share it 1-2 days before the meeting
- Indicate which sections should be read
- Use a file format suitable for adding comments (PDF or doc/x)
- Use a suitable filename (e.g., `2023-12-01-Thesis-Name.pdf`)

We expect you to communicate on an equal level:

- In e-mails, write `"Hallo Herr Wagner"` (instead of `"Sehr geehrter Herr Prof. Dr. Wagner"`).
- If you disagree with a particular suggestion, challenge it and explain why you would do it differently.
- Instead of apologizing, say [thank you](https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/why-you-should-say-thank-you-instead-of-sorry-47250332){: target="_blank"}.

> Keep in mind: There is no perfect thesis and not even a perfect draft - it is always a process of discussing the current version, getting feedback, and refining it.
