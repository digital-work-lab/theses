**Bringing Your Thesis to Life**

Writing should be accessible and free of unnecessary complexity to ensure readers easily grasp your ideas.

## Five Golden Rules

- **Rule 1: Start with a Strong Outline**
  - explains the importance of outlining before starting
  - Outline as the backbone of your thesis
  - provides tips for breaking down your thesis into sections
- **Rule 2: Maintain Consistency**
  - Consistency in tone: formal, clear, and academic
  - Formatting rules: follow a single style guide for margins, headings, and citations
  - suggests tools like Zotero to help manage citations efficiently
- **Rule 3: Prioritize Clarity**
  - guides on using short, direct sentences and avoiding unnecessary jargon
  - advises defining technical terms for readers unfamiliar with the topic
- **Rule 4: Revise Extensively**
  - recommends a multi-step revision process, focusing on structure first, then content, and finally grammar
  - encourages seeking feedback from your supervisor
- **Rule 5: Use Illustrations Wisely**
  - discusses the purpose of visuals and when to include them (e.g., data-heavy sections, complex processes)
  - warns against overloading the thesis with unnecessary graphics


## Writing Process

### From the Outline to the Manuscript

Expanding bullet points into structured paragraphs is key to maintaining coherence. 
Topic sentences should guide the reader through each paragraph, keeping the discussion focused. 
Integrating references smoothly is also important to maintain the logical flow of ideas.

### Recommended Writing Sequence

Starting with the **Methods Section** is recommended, as it is factual and descriptive, laying the foundation for the **Results Section**, where data is presented without interpretation. 
The **Discussion Section** follows, analyzing the results in the context of research objectives. 
The **Introduction and Literature Review** should be written later to align with study findings and to provide proper context. 
Finally, the **Conclusion** summarizes key insights without introducing new ideas.

## Using active voice

It is recommended to use active voice ("I" or "We") instead of passive voice (commonly used in German).

## Topic Sentences

Topic sentences provide clarity and structure, making it easier for readers to follow the argument. 
They are commonly found in high-quality academic writing. 
Good examples of topic sentences can be found in top-tier journal papers like the one of Davis (1989):

> Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use
> 
> What causes people to acceptor reject information technology? Among the many variables that may influence system use, previous research suggests two determinants that are especially important. First, people tend to use or not use an application to the extent they believe it will help them perform their job better. We refer to this first variable as perceived usefulness. Second, even if potential users believe that a given application is useful, they may, at the same time, believe that the systems is too hard to use and that the performance benefits of usage are outweighed by the effort of using the application. That is, in addition to usefulness, usage is theorized to be influenced by perceived ease of use.
> 
> Perceived usefulness is defined here as “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance.” This follows from the definition of the word useful: “capable of being used advantageously.” Within an organizational context, people are generally reinforced for good performance by raises, promotions, bonuses, and other rewards (Pfeffer, 1982; Schein,1980; Vroom,1964). A system high in perceived usefulness, in turn, is one for which a user believes in the existence of a positive use-performance relationship.
> 
> Perceived ease of use, in contrast, refers to “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort.” This follows from the definition of “ease”: “freedom from difficulty or great effort.” Effort is a finite resource that a person may allocate to the various activities for which he or she is responsible (Radner and Rothschild, 1975). All else being equal, we claim, an application perceived to be easier to use than another is more likely to be accepted by users.

## Tense Usage in Academic Writing

The **present tense** is used for general truths, accepted knowledge, and describing the content of the paper. 
For example, "This study investigates..." or "Figure 1 shows..." 
The **past tense** is used to describe specific methods, report findings, and reference prior research, as in "Smith et al. (2020) found..."

## Citation Guidelines

Proper citation ensures recognition of original work and adherence to academic integrity. 
In information systems and computer science, indirect citation is preferred, focusing on theories and findings rather than exact wording. 
APA format is commonly used.

In-text citations can be either parenthetical, such as "Fitness trackers were found to have mixed effects on sedentary behavior (Smith et al., 2006)," or narrative, as in "Smith et al. (2006) analyzed the effectiveness of fitness trackers."
Word-for-word quotations require quotation marks and page numbers, e.g., "A substantial degree of inaccuracy in measuring sleep quality" was found (Smith et al., 2006, p.111). 
Reference managers like Zotero facilitate proper citation formatting.

## When Are Illustrations Needed?

Illustrations should be used to enhance understanding and clarify key points. 
Charts, graphs, or tables are useful for presenting numerical data, while flowcharts or diagrams can help explain methodologies and workflows. 
Concept maps are particularly effective for illustrating theoretical frameworks.
To ensure effectiveness, visuals should be clear, professionally designed, and properly labeled. 
Avoid including large blocks of code or overly complex diagrams; instead, focus on illustrating architecture and key mechanisms concisely.
