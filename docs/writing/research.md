## Support for statistical analyses (BACES)

For students conducting research in their thesis, support from the Bamberger Centrum f√ºr Empirische Studien (BACES) is available.
BACES provides free statistical consultation for students working on seminar papers, thesis projects, and for university members involved in publications.
This service is particularly useful for students needing assistance with statistical analysis and data interpretation.

The BACES team, which consists of professors, researchers, and student assistants, offers:

- **Free methodological consultation** for students and university members on their research projects (seminar and thesis papers, publications).
- **Training sessions** on various statistical topics.
- **Immediate support** on urgent statistical issues every Wednesday between 10 and 11 AM.

For further details on their services and team, you can visit [BACES website](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/baces/){: target="_blank"} or directly reach out for statistical consultation via [BACES consultation page](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/baces/statistische-beratung/){: target="_blank"}.

Please note that the consultations are provided with the consent of thesis advisors. We highly encourage students to take advantage of this valuable resource during their research phase.
