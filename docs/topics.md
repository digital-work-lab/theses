**Thesis Advisor**: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

**Summary**: This thesis aims to provide a detailed understanding of the evolving discourse on the future of work by mapping the network of key researchers and their collaborative structures. The focus will be on identifying influential contributors, recurring themes, and emerging trends within this body of literature. By examining co-citation networks and collaboration patterns, the thesis will uncover how researchers are interconnected, which studies are most frequently referenced, and what relationships exist within this intellectual landscape. Such analysis can inform a more comprehensive understanding of the future of work, helping to identify distinct research clusters and potential areas for further investigation.

**Methods**: The thesis will utilize bibliometric methods and network analysis. Co-citation analysis and author co-authorship networks will be generated from relevant databases (e.g., Web of Science, Scopus) using Python libraries suited for network analysis (e.g., NetworkX, SciPy). Both quantitative and qualitative analyses will be employed to interpret the resulting maps and uncover underlying research themes.

**Expected outcomes**: The thesis will result in a visual and interpretive map of the discourse on the future of work, highlighting core topics, influential authors, and collaborative networks. Findings will include a typology of the main research clusters and an outline of their key contributions to the field. Recommendations for fostering collaboration and identifying underexplored areas within the future of work discourse will also be provided.

**Requirements**: Students should have basic experience with Python and an interest in bibliometric and network analysis. Familiarity with bibliometric databases and prior experience in data analysis is an advantage.

**Thesis Advisor**: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

**Summary**: This thesis focuses on the increasingly popular “awesome lists” on GitHub, which represent an informal but useful method of knowledge collection and synthesis. The goal of the thesis is to use the colrev package to automatically retrieve relevant repositories from GitHub, and subsequently conduct a clustering analysis to distinguish between different types of awesome lists. Categories of awesome lists might include those focusing on datasets, academic publications, or non-academic use cases. The thesis should provide an overview of the landscape of awesome lists, identify prominent examples, and derive best practice recommendations for designing these resources. Furthermore, the thesis will suggest potential ways academia could leverage awesome lists for literature reviews and contribute to their development.

**Methods**: The thesis will employ the colrev package for retrieving and processing GitHub repositories and apply clustering techniques to categorize the awesome lists. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses will be used to identify interesting patterns across the lists. 

**Expected outcomes**: The thesis will result in a comprehensive classification of awesome lists on GitHub, with detailed examples of exemplary lists. It will also provide recommendations on how best to design such lists for different audiences and use cases, including guidance for future academic involvement in these lists. Furthermore, the research will suggest how awesome lists can be applied in systematic literature reviews and knowledge synthesis in academic settings.

**Requirements**: Students should have basic experience with GitHub and Python, particularly in data retrieval and analysis. Familiarity with clustering techniques or the colrev package is an advantage.

## Design of an emulator for API-based academic literature searches
{: .d-inline-block }
#programming
{: .label .label-yellow }
#search-query
{: .label .label-green }

**Thesis Advisor**: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

**Summary**: This thesis aims to advance the use of Boolean queries (queries involving operators like AND, OR, NOT) in API searches in two areas. First, for a suitable API (e.g., PubMed), a parser will be implemented for URLs representing Boolean queries. This will extend existing functionality of the [search-query](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/search-query){: target="_blank"} package and allow users to efficiently run Boolean queries when the API supports it. Second, for APIs that do not support Boolean queries (such as Crossref or DBLP), a novel technique, called *Boolean Emulation for Academic Literature Searches* (BEALS), will be implemented and tested. For this technique, which involves the retrieval of super-sets followed by local execution of Boolean queries, a concept and working prototype are available.

**Methods**: The thesis will adopt a design science approach and proceed in two phases: 1) Parsing query URLs for APIs that already support nested Boolean queries. 2) Developing and implementing the BEALS technique for APIs lacking Boolean operator support, followed by user tests.

**Expected outcomes**: The thesis will provide an extension of the search-query package, demonstrating improved search capabilities for both types of APIs. It will include the design of the BEALS technique, showcasing its ability to emulate Boolean functionalities for simple APIs. These contributions will enhance efficiency of literature searches, ultimately allowing researchers to rely on automated execution instead of manual retrieval from database interfaces.

**Requirements**: Candidates should have completed the [open-source project](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/){: target="_blank"} or have prior experience with Git and Python.

## Advances in literature search queries: Evaluation, analysis, and improvement
{: .d-inline-block }
#programming
{: .label .label-yellow }
#search-query
{: .label .label-green }

**Thesis Advisor**: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

**Summary**: This thesis focuses on literature search queries, and aims to evaluate, analyse, and improve them.
As a first step, a comprehensive dataset from [searchRxiv](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/journal/searchrxiv){: target="_blank"} will be used to parse and evaluate queries for selected databases (such as Web of Science, Pubmed, or IEEE).
This step relies on existing query parsers, may involve refinements of the parser, and ultimately classify each query as valid or erroneous.
As the second step, a linter will be extended to identify different types of problems and offer instructive messages to users.
This work will proceed from syntactical errors (e.g., unbalanced parentheses) to simplification techniques (e.g., use of of wildcards).
We will assist students with the development of a code skeleton (if needed).

**Methods**: The thesis will adopt a design science approach and proceed in two phases: 1) Creating a test dataset of queries based on searchRxiv. 2) Implementing linters, testing them on the dataset, and reporting the results.

**Expected outcomes**: The thesis will verify the functionality of parsers within the search-query package, and develop linters for analyzing and simplifying queries. Based on an analysis of data from searchRxiv, it will further show whether published queries have errors or whether they could be simplified.

**Requirements**: Candidates should have completed the [open-source project](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/){: target="_blank"} or have prior experience with Git and Python.

## Advances in search query tools: A comprehensive evaluation
{: .d-inline-block }
#programming
{: .label .label-yellow }
#search-query
{: .label .label-green }

**Thesis Advisor**: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

**Summary**: This thesis focuses on search query tools, and aims to evaluate how they handle complex queries, and whether there are any limitations.
Similar to the previous topic, in the first step, a comprehensive dataset from [searchRxiv](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/journal/searchrxiv){: target="_blank"} will be used to parse and evaluate queries for selected databases (such as Web of Science, Pubmed, or IEEE).
This step relies on existing query parsers, may involve refinements of the parser, and ultimately classify each query as valid or erroneous.
In the second step, existing search query tools, such as *Polyglot Search* or *Litsonar*, will be evaluated based on this dataset of queries.
The goal is to scrutinize their ability to parse free-text queries, and the formats available for translation. For each tool, it will be analysed whether complex queries with a valid syntax are parsed correctly and without errors, and whether erroneous queries are rejected.
Finally, the research will also involve reporting any identified errors to the developers.

**Methods**: The thesis will adopt a design science approach and proceed in three phases: 1) Creating a test dataset of queries based on searchRxiv. 2) Testing valid and erroneous queries in different tools. 3) Documenting errors, sharing them with the developers, and reporting whether the developers responded or fixed the errors (considering the time frame available for the thesis).

**Expected outcomes**: The thesis will provide a detailed evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of existing search query tools. It will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, provide insights into the most common issues encountered, and assess the responsiveness of developers in addressing reported errors. This work will contribute to the improvement of search query tools and offer practical recommendations for developers and users.

**Requirements**: Candidates should have completed the [open-source project](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/){: target="_blank"} or have prior experience with Git and Python.

## Future of Work: A review of reviews

**Thesis advisor**: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

**Summary**: In recent years, we have seen a tremendous growth of research dedicated to the future of work, covering topics like the transition to remote work, emerging forms of online labour, as well as (techno) stress and well-being. An effective transfer of scientific findings into practice is challenged by the unprecedented volume of research studies published each year. In this context, integrated overviews of existing research are essential to properly inform managerial stakeholders on the key areas and topics investigated by academia. Such work can also offer useful guidance and shape the agendas of researchers. The goal of this thesis is to provide an overview of prior research related to the future of work, focusing on prior review papers exclusively. For example, the reviews of Marsh et al. (2022), Mitchell et al. (2022), and Gol2019 cover relevant facets. More generally, the objective would be to use available guidelines (Thomson et al. 2010), search for review papers on digital work, complete a structured selection process (screen), and synthesize the key findings adopting a concept-centric perspective (see Webster and Watson 2000). Relevant implications for practice and research conclude the thesis.

## Online labour markets: Key constructs, items, and nomological network

**Thesis advisor**: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

**Summary**: Online labour markets enable clients to hire individual workers, often for short-time contracts and tasks ranging from programming to translation services, and online marketing campaigns. Global demand for professional services on online labour markets is growing, but the experience of clients is not always satisfactory. In fact, clients fail to find suitable candidates for less than 75% of jobs in projects exceeding 1,000$ (Snir and Hitt, 2003). Prior research has invested considerable efforts to identify constructs explaining selection decisions and auction success (Wagner and Prester, 2021). Examples for explanatory constructs are worker experience, ratings, and cultural similarity. Yet, we lack an overview of how these constructs are measured (their items) and how they are related to each other in a nomological network. Developing a more systematic overview of the key constructs can draw inspiration from similar studies (e.g., Clark et al., 2007, Zhang and Venkatesh, 2017) and methodological works (e.g., Larsen et al. 2016; Larsen et al. 2020). Such a contribution is important to ensure nomological validity in future studies, to facilitate better compatibility of individual studies, and to achieve higher predictive accuracy, potentially helping clients to utilize online labour markets more effectively.

Literature reviews: Conceptual models and tools for inductive and theoretical work

Literature reviews in the Information Systems as well as the Management and Organizational Disciplines often adopt inductive approaches for synthesis and theory development. This means that authors approach prior reseach with an open mind and let concepts and associations emerge from the analysis (see Wolfswinkel et al., 2013). This differs from deductive approaches in which a specific schema is selected at the beginning and applied to the literature. Inductive work is considered to be particularly valuable because it allows authors to draw new insights from extant work. Yet, it is also considered particularly challenging to complete inductive reviews from a conceptual and practical perspective. Conceptually, a well-known guideline suggests to develop a concept matrix (Webster and Watson, 2001), but less than 10% of theoretical reviews in Information Systems strictly follow this approach. Similarly, there is a lack of guidelines on appropriate tools and how they can support inductive reviews.

The goal of this thesis is to offer conceptual and practical guidance for inductive literature reviews. Conceptually, this could involve an analysis of inductive review papers and current guidelines, including Webster and Watson’s concept matrix, Glaser and Strauß’s Grounded Theory, or Luhmann’s method. Practically, it may be helpful to review available tools, such as MAXDQA, Atlas.TI, Obsidian, or Zettlr, and to simulate inductive work (in line with example review papers). This work should have implications for future inductive and concept-centric reviews, for instance in the form of archetype patterns, methodological propositions, or guidelines for tools.

##  Data science: Design and evaluation of a machine learning classifier for information retrieval

To present users with the most relevant results in information retrieval and collaborative filtering settings, it is imperative to go beyond pure network structure and consider qualitative and (semi-) structured data (Herlocker et al. 2004). For example, a social media-post or newspaper article will be considered more relevant if it matches a users context and the topics s/he is interested in. This notion of relevance may not only be inferred from the original document, but also from others who refer to it (e.g., in the form of mentions and reviews). The objective of this thesis is to leverage data from referring documents to predict which of the original documents are relevant to a user.

The thesis will focus on the context of academic citation networks in which researchers are challenged to evaluate thousands of papers (original documents) to select those relevant to their work (see Prester et al. 2021). An existing data set will be provided (based on Wagner et al. 2021), which contains the network structure, the referring documents, as well as labels of relevance. The referring documents are in TEI formats (generated from PDFs), which allows for an efficient access of referring sections (contents, citations, and context). These structural and semi-structured data elements should be used to develop features as well as to implement and evaluate a machine learning classifier. Ultimately, such classifiers could help to offer more efficient alternatives to what is commonly known as snowballing, citation, or backward searches (Choong et al., 2014, Webster and Watson, 2001).
